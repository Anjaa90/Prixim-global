                            <p>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the most significant European privacy
                                legislation in the last twenty years. It came directly into force on 25 May 2018. The
                                GDPR replaces the EU Data Protection Directive 1995 (European Directive 95/46/EC),
                                strengthens the rights that EU individuals have regarding their data and creates a
                                uniform data protection law across Europe. Brexit will not affect the new regulation as
                                the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has confirmed that the GDPR will be
                                enforceable from 25 </p>
                        </div>

                            <h2>Responsibility and Accountability </h2>
                            <p>These two words should be echoing in the boardroom of the organization from now on with
                                this new regulation. An organization should ask itself questions such as – What types of
                                personal data do we store? Where is it located? How is it available? Are we protecting
                                data sufficiently? Are we sufficiently protecting the rights and interests of the
                                target? Do we have the necessary approval? And most importantly – Are we complying? Data
                                protection should become a board-level discussion because of the huge burden on
                                organizations to comply and the penalties for those who don't. Where the DPA (1998) was
                                typically stricter on companies operating in the EU, the scope of the GDPR extends
                                globally. If an organization holds or processes data that can identify an EU citizen, it
                                must comply regardless of physical location. It also brings data processors into the
                                spotlight. While the GDPR still focuses on the controller, i.e. who collected it and who
                                dictates its use, data processors such as data suppliers are also under scrutiny in
                                terms of liability. </p>

                            <h2>Agreement</h2>
                            <p>Many businesses relied on 'implied' consent during the DPA era. This passive approach was
                                used over the next decade until it was overridden during the GDPR negotiations. Often a
                                pre-ticked box was used indicating that they had opted in or allowed third parties to
                                use their data – and if the consumer didn't bother to uncheck the box, implied consent
                                was given. However, the GDPR states that for consent to be valid there must be a “clear
                                affirmative action”. This will mean actively checking the unchecked consent box.
                                However, for clarity and security, an email should follow - for example "click here to
                                confirm your subscription". This created a double opt-in and is a clear sign that they
                                want their data to be used by the company. . </p>

                            <p>Consumers have the right to request the erasure of their data thanks to the GDPR. All
                                personal data stored about the subject must be deleted unless there is a legitimate need
                                for the business to retain it. </p>

                            <p>Although the requirement to appoint a data protection officer is new under the GDPR, it
                                is a long-standing element of data protection in Germany. Accordingly, the modified
                                version made it into the GDPR. Companies are required to appoint a DPO if they regularly
                                process huge amounts of personal data or process “special category” data on a large
                                scale (eg race, religion, health – anything considered sensitive) </p>

                            <p>The penalty for a data breach has increased dramatically from the maximum fine of
                                £500,000 that was allowed under the DPA. The GDPR provides a comprehensive package for
                                data collection, processing and management and should therefore not be breached. Those
                                who do not comply with the GDPR face heavy fines of up to 2% of annual global turnover.
                                Businesses that suffer a serious data breach face fines of up to €20 million or 4% of
                                annual turnover, whichever is greater. </p>

                            <h2>What Constitutes a Breach?</h2>
                            <p>A data breach is more than just the loss of personal information. A breach of security
                                that results in the destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access of
                                personal information. Breaches vary in severity, so it is important to understand how
                                the organization was breached, what was accessed and how it will affect the rights of
                                the subject(s). Not all violations need to be reported, in some cases they can be dealt
                                with internally without notifying supervisory authorities. However, if the breach is
                                likely to have a "significant and harmful effect on the individual", it must be
                                reported. For example, a data breach that allows unauthorized access to customer
                                transaction data puts entities at risk of becoming victims of identity theft. This
                                should be reported as it poses a threat to the individual's safety. Accidentally
                                changing employee phone numbers on the other hand can be handled in house and not worth
                                reporting. </p>

                            <p>Prominent Contact will follow best data protection practices. This means that we work
                                closely with our data suppliers to ensure that data is collected in accordance with the
                                regulations. A prominent contact will ensure that all information is current and
                                accurate. </p>
                            <p>The main change that the GDPR creates for marketing data is the legal basis on which the
                                data can be processed (or used). Although there are six in total, the two most important
                                to marketing are "legitimate interest" and "consent". </p>
                            <p>Legitimate interest – is the legal basis for the processing of personal data, which the
                                company can use for direct marketing. The business has a legitimate interest in finding
                                new customers; if it balances this interest with the interests and rights of the data
                                subject, it may process personal data for marketing purposes. We believe this means that
                                there should be a clear fit between the product, service or content being communicated,
                                with the individual's role (eg job description), industry or other targeting factor.
                                This relies on high-quality data and strict segmentation criteria. Marketing
                                communications using legitimate interest must then operate on an opt-out or opt-out
                                basis and must comply with other GDPR data processing rules. Prominent Contact will
                                process data based on legitimate interest and provide it to our customers on this basis.
                            </p>
                            <p>Consent - means that the individual whose data is being processed must provide "opt-in"
                                consent. GDPR means that businesses can no longer rely on presumed consent or pre-ticked
                                boxes – replacing them with a requirement for “express or unequivocal” consent by
                                actively ticking an unchecked box or other “clear affirmative action”. Some marketing
                                data must be processed on the basis of consent, which is detailed in the Personal Data
                                Protection and Electronic Communications Regulation (PECR), which extends data
                                protection obligations to marketing by electronic means, and will continue to apply when
                                the GDPR comes into force. In B2B marketing, this especially applies to sending e-mails
                                to unregistered businesses such as sole proprietors.</p>
                            <p>We have concluded that it is not possible for our external email data suppliers to obtain
                                consent to the full extent required by the GDPR. Therefore, we will no longer offer
                                email addresses to unregistered companies at this time. The EU Privacy and Electronic
                                Communications Regulation is currently under development and will eventually replace the
                                PECR. We will of course comply with any new guidelines and criteria and can assure you
                                that Prominent Contact will only sell data that complies with these guidelines. </p>
